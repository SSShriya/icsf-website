# ICSF Website
A society information page for Imperial Sci-fi Fantasy Society.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.19 or higher ([download](https://nodejs.org))
- Run `node --version` to check your current version

## Getting Started
- Run `npm install` after cloning the repo. 
- To run the website: 
  - `npm run build`. This builds the website
  - `npm run dev`. This will start a development server 
  at http://localhost:5173.

## Project Structure
### Source Code
- The project is structured in a feature-first pattern within the `src/`directory. This means that each page has its own folder in `src/`, in which are all relevant HTML/TypeScript files for that page.
- The homepage layout is at `src/index.html`, and the sitemap is at `src/sitemap.html`.
- There are also web components, including the header, footer, and navigation bar, which are reused on every page. These are located in `src/components`
- CSS styles are in `src/styles`

### Assets and Resources
- All assets are in the public/ directory, as configured in the `publicDir` parameter in the Vite config (`vite.config.ts`) 

## Building the Website
The website is built by running `npm run build`

### Step 1: src/build.ts
This script runs firsts, generating the `gallery` page, and the `publications` page, as these HTML pages are easier to automate than to write by hand.
- Gallery (`src/gallery/gallery.ts`): scans `public/gallery/` for album folders, uses the first image in each album as a thumbnail, and writes `src/gallery/index.html` to display the page. It also generates a `photos.json` inside each album folder, listing all of the photos in an album, which the album page fetches at runtime.
- Publications (`src/publications/publications.ts`): scans `public/publications/` for PDFs, parses the filename to extract the date, title and editor, and writes `src/publications/index.html` to display the page.
- History (`src/history/history.ts`): looks at `src/history/events.json`, generates HTML for each event, and writes `src/history/index.html`. 

### Step 2: Vite
- Vite then compiles everything in `src/` into `dist/`. This is where the completely built website lives.

## Configuration
### Deployment URL 
- The base URL for the site is defined in vite.config.ts in the `base` parameter. It sets two different base URLs
  depending on whether the project was run with `npm run build` or `npm run dev`. It specifies the base from which
  all relative URLs are calculated. For asset sources. in HTML pages, Vite automatically calulates from this 
  set base URL. When adding your own links in HTML, use `%BASE_URL%` for relative links. In TypeScript sections,
  such as in the web components, use `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` to get the base url (this will only work during the Vite
  build step, as it get a Vite environment variable.)
- The rest of the configuration can be found in `tsconfig.json` (for TypeScript configuration) and `vite.config.ts` (for Vite build configuration).


## Adding Content
### Add a Fanzine/Publication
- Name the file following this template: YYYY-MM_title_First-Last.pdf, where 'First' and 'Last' are the first and last names of the editor of the fanzine,
  anad 'title' is either the title of the fanzine, or 'Wyrm' if it is a Wyrmtongue issue.
- Drop it into the folder `public/publications/` and rebuild the website.

### Add New Album in Gallery
- Simply drop a folder into `public/gallery/` and rebuild the website.

### Add a New Timeline Event in History 
- Add a new row to the file `src/history/events.json`. Include the date of the event, the title of the event, and an optional link to the event.

### Add a Picocon Page in The History Book
- Take the HTML from the Picocon page, and copy it into `src/history/picocon/picocon(num).html`. Put any assets in a folder `src/history/picocon(num)/` and change the HTML to deal with links properly.
- Copy the styles from the previous Picocon pages:
  - Add a link to `/styles/history.css` in the \<head> section
  - Put the page content into a \<div id="blue-book">
  - Add a 'previous' link to the previous Picocon page 
  - Update the 'next' links in the previous Picocon page 
- Update `src/history/picocon/index.html` to include the link to this Picocon page.

### Add a New Page
- Create a folder in `src/` with the page title, and add an `index.html`.
- Reuse the web components from `src/components/` for the site header, site footer, and navigation bar. This can be done by including them as scripts in the `<head>` section of the HTML, and then simply using them as tags like so: `<site-footer></site-footer>`. See any existing page's `index.html` for examples.
- If the page requires dynamic processing, like the `gallery` page, add a new step to `src/build.ts` to generate HTML in an automated fashion.

## Deployment
- Run `npm run build` and deploy the `dist/` folder.
- The website currently deploys to GitHub Pages through a CI/CD pipeline, 
where the website is built using `npm run build`, the `dist/` folder is uploaded as an artifact, and then deployed to Pages.
